"body": "Description:\nThis Change in Education is a narrative told by a mother to her child about the change in the education system.  She, Sophie, tells her daughter, Margaux, what school was like when she was growing up.  There was the ALP (Advanced Learning Program) and the SLP (Special Learning Program).  She belonged to the latter and was a little envious of the kids in the other program.  She explains how the education system failed her, even into her college years and how lucky her daughter is to have the Lighter Education program of the present.\nI couldn't necessarily identify any common tropes except the mother longing to be like the other kids when she was growing up.\nThe setting is vague.  Sophie drops her daughter off for school, so I can only assume the story takes place in front of Margaux's school or in Sophie's car.  Either way, the setting doesn't seem to matter much for this type of story.\n\nAnalysis:\nThere's not much suspense involved in this type of story, but I liked being able to connect with Sophie since the story was told from her perspective as a narrator.  I really do think that there's a lot of opportunity for more depth in this story and more opportunities to show the readers Sophie and Margaux's emotions and personalities that can be explored.\n\nInterpretation:\nOverall, I really did feel for Sophie, especially in the dialogue with her mother.  However, I also feel that the story lacks some depth.  While there is a positive future presented through Margaux's lessons, we don't really get to experience what that looks like as the readers.  Everything seems very surface level with much more room for exploration in both character and plot.  There aren't many themes evident unless you consider the idea of parents wanting a better future for their children to fit that category.  Because of the nature of the story, I don't really think there's a specific intended audience.  This read could really be for anyone.\n\nJudgement:\nAs I've stated in the previous sections, I think the story could use some more depth.  Flashbacks could become a helpful feature to give more background knowledge on Sophie's experiences in school.  I would love to see scenes of her looking longingly at the ALP students instead of her just stating that to her daughter.  More scenes like the bit of dialogue with her own mother could really bring this story to life.\nAs far as project guidelines are concerned, it has the before and after the 30 year gap, but we never see what caused the change (unless I'm missing something).  We're never told what the catalyst for this change is.\n\n***I'd like to include as a general note that I had trouble viewing the project.  Instead of coming up in the proper Twine format, my browser displayed the html, CSS, and Javascript, so if any of my comments are inaccurate or I missed some of the story it's because I read the section of code that seemed to contain the story dialogue, but it's very possible that I missed some.***",

"body": "Description\n1.\tJack Gleason, Emily, Ethan\n2.\tGrandpa Jack takes his grandchildren through his house, showing them the different technologies he and others use as a result of events that happened in the past\n3.\tThird-person POV\n4.\tNarrative Tropes? Grandpa Jack is the hero. No antagonist, as the environmental shifts are the main struggle in the past. Narrative Techniques? Flashbacks through Grandpa Jack's explanations to his grandchildren. The setting is Grandpa Jacks house, about 30 years after the Pacific Flood of 2022\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n1.\tInterest is created through the grandchildren's questions to Grandpa Jack, and the background story throughout\n2.\tThe moment of dramatic tension is when Grandpa Jack explains the Pacific Flood of 2022, and Emily is bewildered\n3.\tThe story does show us a lot through the backstory nodes and the explanations that Grandpa Jack gives his grandchildren\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n1.\tThe story in general was relaxing and gave a peaceful, optimistic view of the future, with a vague shadow of the struggle that occurred in the past\n2.\tThe story is definitely about a positive future, because Grandpa Jack tells us the reasons why people in the age of the story are healthy, and that energy conservation is a bigger part of this future\n3.\tThemes that emerge are hints of a darker past that gave rise to the solutions that led to the positive future we are seeing in the story. Grandpa Jack is shown to be a hero of this story as he lead the United States Recovery Plan in 2022\n4.\tI think the audience could be focused towards children as a sort of warning of what climate catastrophes could happen in our/their futures, and proposes solutions to how we can combat those catastrophes\n\n\n\nJudgement\n1.\tI think the story is working well so far and takes the approach of presenting the positive future after the main conflicts have occurred\n2.\tThe story does meet the requirements of the project\n3.\tWhat could be done to make the story better? I think that providing some more backstory to the major conflicts could give the story more intrigue. Maybe giving the reader flashbacks to the Pacific Flood of 2022 and the struggles that human had to persevere through could give a better sense of the main struggles. I think its great how this story really emphasizes the \"positive\" outlook this project had us look through, but giving the reader some more of the \"negative\" could give the audience that payoff once we get to that bright future",
